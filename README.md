# Chatbot
An AI Chatbot that uses RAG to answer questions from whatever data source you uplaod to it.

At the moment it contains 4 files about HSBC Insurance.

You can run either of the 2 files, .ipynb and .py to get to the relevant question-answering chatbots.

I will try to make it more easily reproducible but, to make it work for now, you can.

1. Clone the repo
2. Make your virtual environment ( Optional - Google the command for it )
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run either of the Chatbot.ipynb file to get your chatbot ready!
