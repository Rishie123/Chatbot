# Chatbot
An AI Chatbot that uses RAG to answer questions from whatever data source you uplaod to it.

I will try to make it more easily reproducible and organise the code better 
but, you can make a few changes to make it work for your personal use.

1. Clone the repo
2. Make your virtual environment ( Optional - Google the command for it )
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Get your Open AI API key from the OPEN AI website and put it in the Chatbot.ipynb files
5. Run either of the Chatbot.ipynb file to get your chatbot ready!


At the moment it contains 4 pdf files as input, please feel free to change the same, you can find help to put in your preferred data on the official documentation of LangChain or any other article.
